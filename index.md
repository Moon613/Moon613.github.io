# Welcome to the Rain World Achievement mod Documentation.

This mod's primary purpose is to provide an alternative way of viewing your Steam achivements, and additionally serve as a single unified place for other mods to add their own.

To use it, simply install the mod from [Steam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or the [GitHub](https://github.com/Moon613/RWAchievement) for non-Steam downloads of the game.

If you are here, then you probably want to add achievement compatability with your mod, be it a custom campaign or region. Follow the guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQhttps://moon613.github.io/RWAchievement/docs/getting-started.html) to get started.
